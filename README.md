DnD Combat kata
===============
In this exercise you will build a program to simulate one or more rounds of combat according to rules similar to Dungeons and Dragons. The program will determine the order of the character actions, simulate physical combat, and allow characters to cast spells.

The point of this kata to to provide an larger than trivial exercise that can be used to practice TDD. A significant portion of the effort will be in determining what tests should be written and, more importantly, written next.
